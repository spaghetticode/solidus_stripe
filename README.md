Stripe Payment Method for Solidus. It works as a wrapper for the ActiveMerchant Stripe gateway.

---

Installation
------------

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_stripe', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Then run from the command line:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rails g solidus_stripe:install
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

Usage
-----

Navigate to *Settings > Payments > Payment Methods* in the admin panel.
You can now create a new payment method that uses Stripe by selecting
`Stripe credit card` under Type in the New Payment Method form and saving.
The Stripe payment method's extra fields will be now shown in the form.

**Configure via database configuration**

If you want to store your Stripe credentials in the database just
fill the new fields in the form, selecting `custom` (default) in the
Preference Source field.

**Configure via static configuration**

If you want to store your credentials into your codebase or use ENV
variables you can create the following static configuration:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb

Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.static_model_preferences.add(
    Spree::PaymentMethod::StripeCreditCard,
    'stripe_env_credentials',
    secret_key: ENV['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'],
    publishable_key: ENV['STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'],
    stripe_country: 'US',
    v3_elements: false,
    v3_intents: false,
    server: Rails.env.production? ? 'production' : 'test',
    test_mode: !Rails.env.production?
  )
end
```

Once your server has been restarted, you can select in the Preference
Source field a new entry called `stripe_env_credentials`. After saving,
your  application will start using the static configuration to process
Stripe payments.


Using Stripe Payment Intents API
--------------------------------

If you want to use the new SCA-ready Stripe Payment Intents API you need
to change the `v3_intents` preference from the code above to true and,
if you want to allow also Apple Pay and Google Pay payments, set the
`stripe_country` preference, which represents the two-letter country
code of your Stripe account:


```
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.static_model_preferences.add(
    Spree::PaymentMethod::StripeCreditCard,
    'stripe_env_credentials',
    secret_key: ENV['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'],
    publishable_key: ENV['STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'],
    stripe_country: 'US',
    v3_elements: false,
    v3_intents: true,
    server: Rails.env.production? ? 'production' : 'test',
    test_mode: !Rails.env.production?
  )
end
```

Apple Pay and Google Pay
-----------------------

The Payment Intents API now supports also Apple Pay and Google Pay via
the [payment request button API](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button).
Check the Payment Intents section for setup details. Also, please
refer to the official Stripe documentation for configuring your
Stripe account to receive payments via Apple Pay.

It's possible to pay with Apple Pay and Google Pay directly from the cart
page. In order to enable the functionality, you have to override the
view helper method `Spree::OrdersHelper#cart_checkout_payment_method` and
make it return the `Spree::PaymentMethod::StripeCreditCard` instance that
you want to use for the checkout. Of course, rules stated in the paragraph
above must apply also for this payment method.

Once the helper method is set, a view partial with the relevant HTML and
JS code will be injected via `deface` in the cart page.


Migrating from solidus_gateway
------------------------------

If you were previously using `solidus_gateway` gem you might want to
check out our [Wiki page](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_stripe/wiki/Migrating-from-solidus_gateway)
that describes how to handle this migration.

Testing
-------

Then just run the following to automatically build a dummy app if necessary and
run the tests:

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

Releasing
---------

We use [gem-release](https://github.com/svenfuchs/gem-release) to release this
extension with ease.

Supposing you are on the master branch and you are working on a fork of this
extension, `upstream` is the main remote and you have write access to it, you
can simply run:

```
gem bump --version minor --tag --release --remote upstream
```

This command will:

- bump the gem version to the next minor (changing the `version.rb` file)
- commit the change and push it to upstream master
- create a git tag
- push the tag to the upstream remote
- release the new version on RubyGems

Or you can run these commands individually:

```
gem bump --version minor --remote upstream
gem tag --remote upstream
gem release
```
